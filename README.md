# solon-api-docs
### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or macOS** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
